# ✨ Riza's Web Portfolio

Hey there! 👋  
I'm **Muhamad Riza Pahlevi**, just a regular guy who loves turning ideas into websites and 3D art.  
This portfolio is where I showcase the stuff I’ve built — from sleek frontend designs to backend logic and even a little 3D spice 🍥

## 🔧 Tech Stack I Play With

- 🚀 **Astro** — fast, modern site builder
- 💅 **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first, no headache
- 🧠 **JavaScript** — vanilla + modular setup
- 🎨 **Blender / Maya / 3DS Max** — for 3D assets, mods, and creative stuff

## 💻 What's Inside?

Here's a quick peek at the folder layout:

```
.
├── public/            → Static stuff (images, resume, etc.)
├── src/
│   ├── components/    → Reusable chunks (navbar, cards, etc.)
│   ├── layouts/       → Page wrappers
│   └── pages/         → Main pages (like index.astro)
├── .gitignore
├── astro.config.mjs
├── tailwind.config.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```
